# Variable
# Variable are used to hold data, value of variable can be change

user_age = 100
company_name = "Minimal"
email_id = "Gamingseb7@gmail.com"
print("My company name is " + company_name + " and my email id is " + email_id)

# Define multiple variables in a line
a,b,c = 10, "Hello", 20
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

#Assign same value to multiple variable

x="Testing"
y="Testing"
z="Testing"
#Another approach is
x=y=z="Testing"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


# Defining Constant it is defined in capital letters
SCHOOL_CODE = 21335
print(SCHOOL_CODE)
SCHOOL_CODE = 92837
print(SCHOOL_CODE)   
#THERE is no concept of constant in python but we can write the variable in capital letter and it should tell other people to not change the value
