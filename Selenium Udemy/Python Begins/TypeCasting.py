#Take input from user - Age  Add 5 to the age and print it.

age= input("Enter your age: ")
age= int(age) + 5;      #in python input is always taken as a string. So age = age + 5 shows error because age takes input Example: 5 as "5" 
print(age)


#Take Integer to string
print("Your age is " + str(age))
